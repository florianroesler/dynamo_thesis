\section{Motivation}

As of today, there are various available approaches for programmers to distribute workloads across multiple devices within a single machine or even among multiple machines belonging to a cluster. Enhancing single threaded code to a multithreaded program that runs on multiple machines in parallel adds several layers of complexity to a project, which may introduce errors and increased maintenance efforts.

Frameworks like Open Multi-Processing, CUDA or OpenCL allow for the parallel utilization of resources within a machine but in return require programmers to learn extensive APIs or write code in low level languages like C.
At the same time cluster distribution approaches like Hadoop MapReduce require extended configuration management of the participating nodes. MapReduce as well as other techniques like the Message Passing Interface also add a layer of complexity to the written program code that is entirely focused on synchronizing the distributed parts. 
Ultimately, the combination of both levels of parallelization may lead to additional problems, which distract programmers from their original intentions.

\section{Goals}

The main goal of this research is to provide a framework that assists programmers to distribute their programs within a cluster. Thus, the following requirements are defined in order to streamline the development:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
    \item [Heterogeneity]
    The framework should support modern CPUs and GPUs. Thus, devices by the following vendors should be included: AMD, ARM, Intel and NVIDIA. Therefore various workloads and their specific hardware demands can be supported. Additionally, heterogenous hardware allows for a more granular employment of the required resources. For example a more cost saving ARM CPU could be utilized in low demand situations instead of a more potent but also energy demanding Intel CPU.

    \item [Resource Scalability]
    The general purpose of the future system is the management of a cluster with static resources. Still, it is desirable to have the ability to dynamically increase the computational power by utilizing external cloud services like Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2 or others.

    \item [Scalable Speed]
    It is desirable that the user is able to scale the execution speed of their respective task. Therefore it must be possible to add or remove resources to or from a workload without interrupting the overall execution. With that ability the framework would be enabled to handle burst scenarios as well as save resources in the case of continuous low computational demand.
    
    \item [Ease of Programming]
    The introduced framework should provide programmers with an easy to use distribution mechanism without adding noticeable overhead to their development process. Preferably the resulting code should be created in a modern high level language on a high abstraction level.

    \item [Workload Diversity]
    While the submitted workloads could differ in size and required resources they might also have different hardware requirements. For instance, several workloads within the system could be optimized for CPUs and others for GPUs. The framework should support the execution of these workload types and additionally optimize the distribution across the hardware from a global system view.
