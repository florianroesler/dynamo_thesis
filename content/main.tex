\chapter{Dynamic OpenCL}

\section{Distribution Approach}

Choice of distribution -> why not MPI, MapReduce etc.

Choice of Framework -> SnuCL vs VirtualCL vs dOpenCL

Show Benchmarks of dOpenCL

\section{High-Level Abstraction}

Reason why we need the abstraction

Showcase Aparapi

Explain changes made to connect dopencl and aparapi

show benchmark of connection

\section{Job Design}

show own code and what that means for programming workflow

design considerations and limitations of Aparapi

\section{Hybrid Cloud}

explain the connection of between a local cloud and an external cloud

use amazon as example

also consider security

\section{Scalable Speed}

introduce general scaling idea based on the job design

show the necessary changes towards dopencl and aparapi

\section{Optimized Scheduling}

explain general scheduling structure of dynamo

bring out the fancy stuff like performance history based approach and based on location of the machine

how about simplex?

\section{Exemplary Use Cases}

pure shared local cloud without scaling options

pure remote cloud with the server running in the cloud itself

hybrid cloud

use the framework as a library for a job itself

\section{Limitations}

show bottlenecks (memory of central machine and network in total)

jobs that make sense

job design limitations

\section{Showcase: Dynamo Server}
